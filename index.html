        <p>The underlying purpose of any interface is control. User's wishes mapped onto the system's capabilities. This project focuses on the structure of this mapping, from the micro-scale (a single point of interaction), to medium - feature list, layout, to macro - modularity and customization. We'll explor micro-interactions, contextual controls, gestalt principles in interface design and the underlying system capabilities that could afford a set of interface options.</p>
