                        <p class="section-title2">Assignment: Stephanie Houde and Charles Hill, What do Prototypes Prototype?</p>
                        <p class="section-title">Quote #1 : "What is a prototype?"</p>
                        <p class="section-paragraph">From the reading, I've learned that the term “prototype” is likely to be ambiguous for different types of designers, and everyone has a different expectation of what a prototype is. For example, even though from my knowledge that interaction designers always collaborate with programmers, the word "prototype" 's definition is still different for them. Interaction designers think that it is a simulation of on-screen appearance and behavior, while programmers refer it as a test program.</p>
                        <p class="section-title">Quote #2 : "What is significant is not what media or tools were are used to create them, but how they are used by a designer to explore or demonstrate some aspect of the future artifact."</p>
                        <p class="section-paragraph">A prototype is successful when it satisfied the goal of "helping viewer better understand a product", therefore, what is important is the idea behind the prototype and helping designers to convey that idea to the audience, instead of focusing on how the prototype is made.</p>
                        <p class="section-title">Quote #3 : "The necessary resolution and fidelity of a prototype may depend most on the nature of its audience."</p>
                        <p class="section-paragraph">"Knowing who the adience are" is very important for prototypes because different audience may require a different resolution and fiedelity prototype. A design team might be able to understand an interactive storyboard easily, comparing to members of the supporting organization, where they might require higher-resolution / fidelity representations.</p>

                    <p class="section-title">Quote #1 : "No matter where you go, you are surrounded by systems."</p>
                    <p class="section-paragraph">The first sentence from the article, "No matter where you go, you are surrounded by systems." states that the world is made up of a system, which a system could be as simple as a clock, or as complex as the internet, made up of millions of web networks, everything is closely tied with a system.</p>
                    <p class="section-title">Quote #2 : "Design systems offer a different way of thinking."</p>
                    <p class="section-paragraph">As a designer, instead of thinking to only make a single product or design, we sometimes could also focus on to design a group of interacting parts to join as a common whole, in order to make the design look cohesive and come together as whole.</p>
                    <p class="section-title">Quote #3 : "Code allows designers to not just create designs, but build digital systems that create designs."</p>
                    <p class="section-paragraph">Coding is closely tied together with art and design, it is also a form of art, programmers needs to consider in depth about different forms of shapes, color thoery, composition, just like how a designer or artist would consider. And Code allows designers to not only be able to create designs, but also build digital system systems that create designs.</p>

                    <p class="section-title">Quote #1 : "I prefer to see it for what it is: the colonization of everyday life by information processing."</p>
                    <p class="section-paragraph">A few sentences into the article, the author explains the internet of things. I just thought it is interesting to see how our teachnology and society are evolved in such a great speed, having the internet of things and data communication embed and distribute through our entire environment.</p>
                    <p class="section-title">Quote #2 : “Like the smartphone, the internet of things isn’t a single technology“</p>
                    <p class="section-paragraph">The internet of things isn't a single technology made for one single purposes, instead, it is made up with various devices, services, etc, all for the sake of disciplinary convinience that was fit in our everyday circumstance to the network for analysis and response.</p>
                    <p class="section-title">Quote #3 : "Each of these scales of activity illuminates a different aspect of the challenge presented to us by the internet of things, and each of them has something distinct to teach us."</p>
                    <p class="section-paragraph">The author gave examples on the capabilities of "The Internet of Things", as he stated "Quantified Self", "The Smart Home", and even "The Smart City", presenting the IoT to us in diverse ways, as each of them has something distinct to teach us.</p>
